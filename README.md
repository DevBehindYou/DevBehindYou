# 👋 Hey there, I'm DevBehindYou

I build things with **Flutter**, explore patterns in **data**, and break the internet (sometimes) with **web experiments**.

## 🚧 What I'm Learning Right Now

- Building polished mobile UIs with **Flutter**
- Playing with data and models in **Python**
- Bringing ideas to life using **HTML, CSS, JS**

---

## 🤝 Let’s Work Together If You’re Into

- Flutter-based mobile apps that don’t look like clones  
- Real-world **data projects** that ask better questions  
- Web ideas with just the right amount of weird
