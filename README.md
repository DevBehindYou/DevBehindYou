# 👋 Hey there, I'm DevBehindYou | I Engineer Visibility.

I don’t just write code; I build high-performance web solutions designed to be found. 

At the intersection of **Technical Execution** and **Strategic Growth**, I bridge the gap between building a product and ensuring it reaches the right audience.

### 💎 My Three Pillars of Growth
| **Development** | **SEO Engine** | **Data Driven** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Performance-First. Architecting high-speed, scalable web applications with technical SEO baked into the first line of code. | I engineer visibility. Moving beyond keywords to align technical structure with user intent and algorithms. | Insight-Led. I don't guess; I measure. Using analytics to validate what works and optimize for measurable business outcomes. |
